Redux - Scalable State Container for JavaScript Apps  

Redux is a **predictable state container** designed for **scalable, immutable, and deterministic** state management. It leverages **unidirectional data flow**, a **single immutable state tree**, and **pure function reducers** to facilitate predictable application behavior, time-travel debugging, and efficient UI rendering via **memoized selectors**.
